\subsection{Introduction}
The VFLibGraph library is a graph matching library that is written in C++, it was developed at the Intelligent Systems and Artificial Vision Lab (SIVALab) which is situated in the University of Naples [13]. The library was originally developed to test the VF algorithm [13], the predecessor of the VF2 algorithm, but the library has since evolved to include some of the latest graph matching algorithms such as the Schmidt and Druffel algorithm.

\subsection{Using the library}
The library provides interfaces to the implemented algorithms that it has in its employ, and it also has a comprehensive documentation of how each algorithms interface can be constructed, as well as the matching process between two input graphs.\newline\newline
We have constructed interfaces for the Ullman algorithm and the VF2 algorithm to test against our data set, which comprises on graphs of various number of vertices and edges.
