\subsection{Experiment}
The experiment that is conducted on the Ullman [1] and the VF2 [11] algorithm uses a quantitative approach that evaluates the algorithms against each 
other. The search graph matching algorithms are implemented and experimented on, using two digraph objects at a time. The experiment for that is 
employed, measures and records the algorithms ability and performance of the algorithms in cases where Graph $G${\tiny A} and Graph $G${\tiny B} are 
either partially or completely isomorphic.
\subsubsection{Experiment implementation}

We will refer to Graphs $G${\tiny A} and $G${\tiny B} in this context.\newline\newline
The algorithm has to insert an arbitrarily large number of nodes.\newline\newline
The comparison that is done, is dependent on the relationship between Graph $G${\tiny A} and $G${\tiny B}.\newline\newline
\textbf{Syntactic comparison}					
\begin{myEnumerate}
\item $G${\tiny A} is compared with the whole of $G${\tiny B} for syntactical similarity.										
\begin{myEnumerate}
\item A new subgraph of Graph B is generated.
\item The subgraph is compared with Graph $G${\tiny A} for syntactical similarity.											
\begin{myEnumerate}
\item The time taken to perform the comparison is recorded.
\item The amount of memory used by the algorithm to perform the comparison is recorded.
\end{myEnumerate}	
\item Once all the subgraphs of Graph B have been experimented upon, the result of the subgraph with the best degree of syntactical(isomorphic) 
similarity is then considered the found subgraph.
\end{myEnumerate}
\item If Graph $G${\tiny A} and $G${\tiny B} are not completely syntactically similar, Graph $G${\tiny A} is compared with all the possible subgraphs of Graph B.
\end{myEnumerate}

The recorded results from all the algorithms is analyzed and used to identify which amongst the algorithms is the best and for which cases it is the best in.\\
The results from the algorithms are weighed against a comparison criteria, and it is this criteria that is used to evaluate the algorithms against each other.\\

\subsubsection{The comparison criteria}
The criteria that the algorithm results are weighed against is specified below.
\begin{myEnumerate}
	\item Space efficiency
	\item Time efficiency
 \end{myEnumerate}
 \break
 
Once the results have been obtained and throughly evaluated, then the algorithms with the best perform per criteria field are recorded.\\
And from that set, the best algorithm is chosen overall relative to the others based on the criteria.
