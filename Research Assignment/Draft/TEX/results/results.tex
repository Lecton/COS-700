\label{Experiment Results}
This chapter presents the results of the Ullman and the VF2 algorithms on the proposed data set in chapter \ref{Data Set}. An evaluation of the results is
performed before the algorithms can be compared against each other based on the criteria specified in chater \ref{Experimentation}, namely the time and 
space efficiency of the algorithms.
