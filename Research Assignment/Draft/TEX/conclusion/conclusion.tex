\section{Conclusion}
\label{Conclusion}
This chapter introduces the result of the comparison of the algorithms based on chater \ref{Experiment Results}. The results in chapter \ref{Experiment Results} 
indicated that the two algorithms are arbitrarily similar with regards to the amount of memory used when performng the graph matching procedures of their
respective executions.\newline\newline
The two algorithms perform very differently when it comes to their respective execution times. The Ullman algorithm requires a a lot of time complete its 
exection, even best cases scenrio where the conditions are favourable. The time required accross all different cases is relatively consistant.\newline
The VF2 algorithm performs differently accross its test cases. The algorithm requires very little time to complete its graph matching procedures for the 
best cases, but the time required gradually increases as the cases become worse. Thus based on the presented evidence,the deduction that the VF2 algorithm 
is more efficient than the Ullman algorithm when considering the time required to complete its execution.
