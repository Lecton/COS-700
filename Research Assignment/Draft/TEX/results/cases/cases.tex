\subsubsection{Introduction}
This chapter evaluates the best, average and worst cases for the Ullman and the VF2 algorithms in terms of time and memory efficiency. The best, average and wworst 
cases are by the graph traversal stratedy that is followed by both algorithms as well as the number of edges that the graphs have.\newline\newline
The best, average and worst cases for graph matching are define as follows:\newline\newline
\textbf{Best case:} The best case for graph matching $G${\tiny A} onto graph $G${\tiny B} is defined as a graph $G${\tiny A} having no 
edges defined in their graphs, i.e $E${\tiny A} $=$ 0. \newline\newline
\textbf{Average case:} The average case for graph matching $G${\tiny A} onto $G${\tiny B} is defined as a graph $G${\tiny A} with half of its vertices having 
no edges, and the other half of the vertices are connected to each other.\newline\newline
\textbf{Worst case:} The worst case for matching graph $G${\tiny A} onto $G${\tiny B} is defined as a graph $G${\tiny A} with all its vertices connected to eact other.
